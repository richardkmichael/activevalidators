# ActiveValidators [![Travis](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cesario/activevalidators.png)](http://travis-ci.org/cesario/activevalidators)

# Description

ActiveValidators is a collection of off-the-shelf and tested ActiveModel/ActiveRecord validations.

## Installation

    gem install activevalidators

This projects follows [Semantic Versioning a.k.a SemVer](http://semver.org). If you use Bundler, you can use the stabby specifier `~>` safely.

## Usage

In your models, the gem provides new validators like `email`, or `url`:

```ruby
    class User
      validates :email_address, :email => true # == :email => { :strict => false }
      validates :link_url,      :url   => true
      validates :user_phone,    :phone => true
      validates :password,      :password => { :strength => :medium }
      validates :twitter_at,    :twitter => { :format => :username_with_at }
      validates :twitter_url,   :twitter => { :format => :url }
      validates :twitter,       :twitter => true
      validates :postal_code,   :postal_code => { :country => :us }
    end

    class Article
      validates :slug,          :slug => true
      validates :expiration_date,
                      :date => {
                                 :after => lambda { Time.now },
                                 :before => lambda { Time.now + 1.year }
                               }
    end

    class Device
      validates :ipv6,          :ip => { :format => :v6 }
      validates :ipv4,          :ip => { :format => :v4 }
    end

    class Account
      validates :any_card,      :credit_card => true
      validates :visa_card,     :credit_card => { :type => :visa }
      validates :credit_card,   :credit_card => { :type => :any  }
    end

    class Order
      validates :tracking_num,  :tracking_number => { :carrier => :ups }
    end
```

Exhaustive list of supported validators and their implementation:

* `credit_card` : based on the `Luhn` algorithm
* `date`  : based on the `DateValidator` gem
* `email` : based on the `mail` gem
* `ip`    : based on `Resolv::IPv[4|6]::Regex`
* `password` : based on a set of regular expressions
* `phone` : based on a set of predefined masks
* `postal_code`: based on a set of predefined masks
* `respond_to`
* `slug`  : based on `ActiveSupport::String#parameterize`
* `tracking_number`: based on a set of predefined masks
* `twitter` : based on a regular expression
* `url`   : based on a regular expression

## Todo

Lots of improvements can be made:

* Implement new validators
* ...

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

## Creating a new validator
### Move this to a wiki entry

* Uses minitest/spec
* Create a gemset
* bundle install --binstubs (insure dev gems are installed, minitest,
  etc.)
* Create spec / tests: 'test/validations/foo_test.rb' -> compare
  existing spec files
* If you want to make a new project which uses your activevalidators
  fork for testing, in your project Gemfile use:
  'gem "activevalidators", :path => "/path/to/your/fork"'
* Verify bundler sees your fork: "bundle show -v" ("gem list" will not
  show :path or :git sources gems)
* Run you project with "bundle exec ruby my_project.rb" or "require
  'bundler/setup'" in my_project.rb
